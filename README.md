# 16-bit-Vedic-Multipler


Introduction:
	Vedic mathematics - a gift given to this world by the ancient sages of India. A system which is far simpler and more enjoyable than modern mathematics. The simplicity of Vedic Mathematics means that calculations can be carried out mentally though the methods can also be written down.
There are many advantages in using a flexible, mental system. Pupils can invent their own methods, they are not limited to one method. This leads to more creative, interested and intelligent pupils. Vedic Mathematics refers to the technique of Calculations based on a set of 16 Sutras, or aphorisms, as algorithms and their upa-sutras or corollaries derived from these Sutras. Any mathematical problems (algebra, arithmetic, geometry or trigonometry) can be solved mentally with these sutras. Vedic Mathematics is more coherent than modern mathematics. Vedic Mathematics offers a fresh and highly efficient approach to mathematics covering a wide range - starts with elementary multiplication and concludes with a relatively advanced topic, the solution of non-linear partial differential equations. But the Vedic scheme is not simply a collection of rapid methods; it is a system, a unified approach. Vedic Mathematics extensively exploits the properties of numbers in every practical application

	The word ‘Vedic’ is derived from the word ‘veda’ which means the store-house of all knowledge. Vedic mathematics is mainly based on 16 Sutras (or aphorisms) dealing with various branches of mathematics like arithmetic,algebra, geometry etc.These Sutras along with their brief meanings are enlisted below alphabetically.
Types:
1) (Anurupye) Shunyamanyat – If one is in ratio, the other is zero
2) Chalana-Kalanabyham – Differences and Similarities.
3) Ekadhikina Purvena – By one more than the previous one
4) Ekanyunena Purvena – By one less than the previous one
5) Gunakasamuchyah – The factors of the sum is equal to the sum of the factors
6) Gunitasamuchyah – The product of the sum is equal to the sum of the product
7) Nikhilam Navatashcaramam Dashatah – All from 9 and the last from 10
8) Paraavartya Yojayet – Transpose and adjust.
9) Puranapuranabyham – By the completion or noncompletion
10) Sankalana-vyavakalanabhyam – By addition and by subtraction
11) Shesanyankena Charamena – The remainders by the last digit
12) Shunyam Saamyasamuccaye – When the sum is the same that sum is zero
13) Sopaantyadvayamantyam – The ultimate and twice the penultimate
14) Urdhva-tiryakbyham – Vertically and crosswise
15) Vyashtisamanstih – Part and Whole
16) Yaavadunam – Whatever the extent of its deficiency

Urdhva Triyagbhyam:
	The basic sutras and upa sutras in the Vedic Mathematics helps to do almost all the numeric computations in easy and fast manner. The sutra which we employ in this
project is Urdhva Triyagbhyam (Multiplication).
